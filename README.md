# cs0320 Term Project

**Team Members:** Sang Ha Park, Juanda Tan, Jongje Kim, Yong Hyun Kwon

**Project Idea:** Dixit Online

**Mentor TA:** Nicholas DeMarco

## Project Requirements

**Feature 1**: Board display  
The board must collect and display the card that each player contributes as a guess to the given sentence. It must display it in such a way as to allow each player to vote on the card they think best represents the sentence. Voting should involve clicking on one of the displayed cards.  

**Feature 2**: Turn management and personal hand display  
Each player must know at every turn whether he/she is a guesser or the storyteller for the turn. If the player is the storyteller for the turn, then his/her GUI must allow him/her to select a card for his/her hand, and input a sentence associated with the chosen card.  

If the player is a guesser, then his/her GUI must display the sentence that was given by the storyteller, and his/her hand of cards from which he/she may pick the card they think best represents the given sentence. The guesser must be able to select a card and submit his/her selection.  

There should be a timer running at every turn, which will dictate the time remaining for the player to make a guess, or offer a sentence.  

**Feature 3**: Voting system  
The total number of votes for each card must be tabulated. Each player must receive a notification on how many votes his/her selected card has received after the turn, as this would inform the number of points that was awarded to the player.  

The voting system must also recognize the case where the card selected by the storyteller received 0 votes, or a number of votes equal to the number of guessers. In this scenario, all players except the storyteller should receive points.  

**Feature 4**: Scoring system  
Points should be counted and updated after every round. Every player’s should be able to see their own points, and every other player’s points.  

The game should end once a predetermined number of points is reached by a player.  

**Feature 5**: Card deck  
The deck should allow players to draw a new card at every turn, and keep track of the remaining cards to form the selection of cards that can be drawn in later turns. If the deck runs out of cards, players will not be able to draw cards, and the game will continue until players run out of cards.
